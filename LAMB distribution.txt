Oops, forgot to copy the problem description with the full narrative. You'll have to read my boring synopsis.

Basically, given a (large) positive integer n, compute the length of the longest sequence of numbers whose successive terms double, but sum to less than n.

By the same token, compute the length of the longest fibonacci sequence whose terms sum to less than n.

The function should return the difference between these two lengths.
